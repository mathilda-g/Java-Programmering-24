# Java Collections - Practice Exercises
_Disclaimer_: The following exercises have been created using AI Tools, they are based on information from lecture 7 of the course "Programmering f√∂r testare" at ITHS. 
 
## Warm-up Exercise üåÖ
Before diving into collections, let's warm up our programming skills! 

Create a simple array of integers with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Write code to:
1. Print all numbers
2. Print the sum of all numbers
3. Print all numbers in reverse order

This will help you remember array basics before we move to collections! 

## "Easy" Exercises üå±

### B1: List Basics
Create an `ArrayList<String>` that contains your favorite colors. Write code to:
- Add at least 3 colors
- Print all colors
- Check if "blue" exists in your list
- Remove one color and print the updated list

### B2: Set Introduction
Create a `HashSet<Integer>` and demonstrate how it handles duplicates:
- Add the numbers: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3
- Print the set
- Print the size of the set
- Try to explain why the size is what it is

### B3: Queue Practice
Create a `Queue<String>` representing people waiting in line at a coffee shop:
- Add at least 3 people to the queue
- Print who is first in line
- Serve (remove) the first person
- Add another person to the queue
- Print the entire queue

## Intermediate Exercises üåø

### I1: List Operations
Create an `ArrayList<Integer>` with numbers 1-10. Write methods to:
- Remove all even numbers
- Double all remaining numbers
- Calculate the average of the remaining numbers
- Print the final list and the average

### I2: Set Comparison
Create two `HashSet<String>` objects containing names of fruits:
- Set 1: "apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"
- Set 2: "apple", "mango", "grape", "pear"
Write code to find:
- Which fruits are in both sets?
- Which fruits are unique to Set 1?
- Which fruits are unique to Set 2?

### I3: Map Usage
Create a `HashMap<String, Integer>` to store student names and their scores:
- Add at least 5 student-score pairs
- Print all students who scored above 90
- Find and print the student with the highest score
- Calculate the average score of all students

## Hard Exercises üå≥

### H1: List Manipulation
Create an `ArrayList<Integer>` with 20 random numbers between 1-100.
Write methods to:
- Sort the list in ascending order without using Collections.sort()
- Remove all numbers that appear more than once
- Find the second-highest number
- Calculate the median value

### H2: Custom Object Collections
Create a class `Book` with properties:
- title (String)
- author (String)
- year (int)
- isbn (String)

Then create a `HashSet<Book>` and:
- Add several books (including some duplicates with same ISBN)
- Override equals() and hashCode() to prevent duplicate ISBNs
- Create a method to find all books by a specific author
- Sort the books by year using a TreeSet

### H3: Advanced Map Operations
Create a `HashMap<String, List<Integer>>` to store student names and their test scores throughout the year:
- Add at least 3 students with 4 test scores each
- Calculate each student's average score
- Find the student with the most improved scores (biggest difference between first and last test)
- Create a method to get all students whose average is above a given threshold

## Challenge Exercises üèÜ

### C1: Library Management System
Create a simple library management system using various collections:
- Use a `Map<String, Book>` to store books by ISBN
- Use a `Set<String>` to store member IDs
- Use a `Map<String, List<String>>` to track which books are borrowed by which members
- Implement methods for:
  * Adding new books
  * Registering new members
  * Borrowing books
  * Returning books
  * Listing all books borrowed by a member
  * Finding most popular books (most times borrowed)

### C2: Tournament Bracket Generator
Create a tournament bracket system using various collections:
- Use a `Queue<String>` for participants waiting to play
- Use a `Map<String, Integer>` to store player scores
- Use a `List<List<String>>` to represent tournament rounds
- Implement methods for:
  * Adding participants
  * Generating random matches
  * Recording match results
  * Advancing winners to next round
  * Displaying current tournament status
  * Determining tournament winner

## Tips for All Exercises üí°
- Start with simpler tasks and gradually move to more complex ones
- Test your code with different inputs
- Consider edge cases (empty collections, null values, etc.)
- Use appropriate exception handling where needed
- Document your code with comments
- Try to make your code as clean and readable as possible

## Need Help? ü§î
Remember these resources:
- Java Documentation for Collections
- Your lecture notes
- Draw diagrams if you're stuck
- Break down complex problems into smaller steps
- Ask for help after trying to solve it yourself first

Good luck with your exercises! Remember, practice makes perfect! üöÄ
